## Distributed Processing & Multi-Instance Support

The Transaction File Ingestor is designed for horizontal scalability with built-in support for multiple concurrent instances:

### Multi-Instance Coordination

**Metadata Store Synchronization**
- Spring Integration's **metadata store** tracks processed files across all instances
- Stores file processing state in PostgreSQL (distributed, persistent storage)
- File tracking uses globally unique identifiers and timestamps
- Prevents duplicate file processing even when multiple instances are running

**How It Works:**
1. When an instance retrieves a file, it records the file name and processing state in the metadata store
2. Before processing a file, all instances check the metadata store for previous processing
3. If a file has already been processed by any instance, it is skipped
4. Upon successful processing, the completion status is recorded with the instance ID and timestamp

### Load Balancing

**Distributed Polling**
- Multiple instances can poll the SFTP server simultaneously
- Spring Integration's polling mechanism is stateless and instance-independent
- Each instance independently checks for new files based on configured polling intervals
- No polling coordination needed—metadata store ensures no duplicate processing

**File Distribution:**
- Files are naturally distributed across instances based on polling timing
- Heavy-load files are processed independently by instances that detect them
- Processing throughput scales linearly with the number of instances
- Configurable chunk sizes allow fine-tuning per instance capacity

### Consistency Guarantees

**Idempotent Processing**
- Metadata store prevents re-processing of already-handled files
- Transaction-based operations ensure atomicity
- PostgreSQL ACID compliance provides consistency across instances
- Failed processing attempts can be safely retried

**Instance Failure Recovery**
- If an instance fails during file processing, the metadata store maintains the state
- Other instances continue processing remaining files
- Failed job can be restarted on a different instance without data loss
- Spring Batch's job repository tracks execution history for auditing

### Monitoring Multi-Instance Deployments

**Per-Instance Metrics**
- Each instance exposes `/actuator/metrics` endpoint with instance-specific data
- Spring Boot provides server.port=0 for dynamic port assignment in Kubernetes
- Instance identifiers can be set via `spring.application.instance-id`

**Centralized Observability**
- All instances write events to the same Kafka topic
- Kafka naturally provides ordering guarantees per partition
- Distributed traces correlate logs across instances via event IDs
- PostgreSQL metadata store provides centralized audit trail

## Engineering Highlight: Distributed Race Condition Fix

This project led to a core framework improvement in **Spring Integration** by identifying and resolving a critical race condition affecting clustered deployments.

## The Challenge: "Exactly-Once" File Processing
When running this application in a horizontally scaled environment (multiple instances), we utilized the `JdbcMetadataStore` to ensure that each file from an SFTP source was processed by only one node.

However, we discovered that under high concurrency, multiple nodes would simultaneously attempt to "claim" the same file. This resulted in:
* **PostgreSQL:** `DuplicateKeyException` causing a complete transaction rollback.
* **MySQL/MariaDB:** `CannotAcquireLockException` during index updates.
* **Result:** The entire polling cycle would fail with "Transaction aborted" or "Read-only transaction" errors, rather than simply skipping the file.

## Discovery & Open Source Contribution
I documented this behavior and provided a reproducible case to the Spring team, leading to a framework-level fix that introduced database-specific "upsert" logic to handle these collisions gracefully.

* **Discussion:** [Stack Overflow #78979169](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78979169/)
* **Official Fix:** Implemented in **Spring Integration 6.4.0**, and backported to **6.3.4** and **6.2.9**.

## Technical Solution
By upgrading to the fixed versions, this project now handles concurrent inserts safely using native database features:
1.  **PostgreSQL:** Uses `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` to prevent transaction death.
2.  **MySQL/MariaDB:** Improved exception translation to handle lock-wait timeouts without crashing the poller.

### Deployment Scenarios

**Scale-Up Example (1 to 3 instances):**
```bash
# Instance 1
docker run -e spring.profiles.active=local -e spring.application.instance-id=ingestor-1 transaction-file-ingestor

# Instance 2
docker run -e spring.profiles.active=local -e spring.application.instance-id=ingestor-2 transaction-file-ingestor

# Instance 3
docker run -e spring.profiles.active=local -e spring.application.instance-id=ingestor-3 transaction-file-ingestor
```

All three instances:
- Share the same PostgreSQL metadata store
- Share the same Kafka cluster
- Share the same SFTP server connection
- Coordinate file processing through metadata store
- Independently poll for new files

The following performance test was conducted on a local machine processing a large transaction dataset through the `fileToKafkaStep` batch step:

**Test Configuration:**
- **Test Date:** March 6, 2026
- **Step Name:** fileToKafkaStep
- **Total Items Processed:** 50,000 transactions
- **Data Volume:** 5,000,000 items written to Kafka
- **Total Execution Time:** 5 minutes 53 seconds 119 milliseconds
- **Job Status:** COMPLETED

**Batch Step Execution Details:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Items Read** | 50,000 |
| **Total Items Written** | 5,000,000 |
| **Skip Count** | 0 |
| **Rollback Count** | 0 |
| **Filter Count** | 0 |
| **Processing Status** | COMPLETED |
| **Total Duration** | 5m 53s 119ms |

**Performance Metrics:**

|--------|-------|
| **Throughput** | ~142 items/second |
| **Items per Minute** | ~8,547 items/min |
| **Average Processing Time per Item** | ~7.06 milliseconds |
| **Write Multiplier** | 100x (50K items → 5M Kafka events) |

**Key Findings:**

1. **Stable Throughput:** Processing 50,000 transactions in approximately 5 minutes 53 seconds demonstrates consistent, reliable performance on local hardware
2. **Zero Errors:** Skip count of 0 and rollback count of 0 indicate flawless data processing with no data quality issues or failures
3. **Efficient Batch Processing:** The batch step executed without any filtering or skipping, achieving 100% successful processing rate
4. **Write Volume:** Each transaction generates 100 Kafka events on average (50K items → 5M total writes), demonstrating rich event publishing capability
5. **Scalability:** Linear scaling expected when adding multiple instances—throughput should increase proportionally with number of concurrent processors

**Batch Job Execution Timeline:**

```
Job Start:        2026-03-06 14:10:20.599913
Step Start:       2026-03-06 14:10:20.602499
Step End:         2026-03-06 14:16:13.704766
Job Completion:   2026-03-06 14:16:13.716 (Job Launcher confirmed)

Total Duration:   5 minutes 53 seconds 119 milliseconds
```

**Running Your Own Performance Tests:**

To conduct local performance testing:

```bash
# 1. Start infrastructure services
docker-compose -f docker/postgres/docker-compose.yml up -d
docker-compose -f docker/sftp/docker-compose.yml up -d
docker-compose -f docker/kafka/docker-compose.yml up -d

# 2. Wait for services to be ready
sleep 10

# 3. Build the application
mvn clean package -DskipTests

# 4. Run the application with local profile
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments="--spring.profiles.active=local"

# 5. Monitor the job execution via logs (look for "Job completed" message)

# 6. Query batch execution details from PostgreSQL
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d transactiondb -c \
  "SELECT step_execution_id, step_name, status, read_count, write_count, skip_count, rollback_count, 
          start_time, end_time, (extract(epoch from end_time - start_time)) as duration_seconds 
   FROM batch_step_execution 
   WHERE step_name = 'fileToKafkaStep' 
   ORDER BY step_execution_id DESC LIMIT 5;"
```

**Understanding the Results:**

- **Read Count (50,000):** Number of transaction records processed from the input file
- **Write Count (5,000,000):** Total events published to Kafka (typically 100 events per transaction for comprehensive event coverage)
- **Skip Count (0):** No records were skipped due to errors or filtering
- **Rollback Count (0):** No failed chunks requiring rollback
- **Status (COMPLETED):** Step executed successfully without errors

**Performance Optimization Tips:**

1. **Chunk Size:** The current chunk size is optimized for the local machine. Adjust in `application-local.yml` to match your hardware
2. **Thread Pool:** Enable parallel processing by configuring `spring.batch.job.step-handler-task-executor.max-pool-size` for multi-threaded chunk processing
3. **Memory Settings:** For larger datasets, increase JVM heap size: `JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx4g -Xms2g"`
4. **Kafka Partitions:** Increase Kafka topic partitions to match the number of processing threads for better throughput
5. **Database Connection Pool:** Configure `spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size` based on your concurrent processing threads
