## Distributed Processing & Multi-Instance Support

The Transaction File Ingestor is designed for horizontal scalability with built-in support for multiple concurrent instances:

### Multi-Instance Coordination

**Metadata Store Synchronization**
- Spring Integration's **metadata store** tracks processed files across all instances
- Stores file processing state in PostgreSQL (distributed, persistent storage)
- File tracking uses globally unique identifiers and timestamps
- Prevents duplicate file processing even when multiple instances are running

**How It Works:**
1. When an instance retrieves a file, it records the file name and processing state in the metadata store
2. Before processing a file, all instances check the metadata store for previous processing
3. If a file has already been processed by any instance, it is skipped
4. Upon successful processing, the completion status is recorded with the instance ID and timestamp

### Load Balancing

**Distributed Polling**
- Multiple instances can poll the SFTP server simultaneously
- Spring Integration's polling mechanism is stateless and instance-independent
- Each instance independently checks for new files based on configured polling intervals
- No polling coordination needed—metadata store ensures no duplicate processing

**File Distribution:**
- Files are naturally distributed across instances based on polling timing
- Heavy-load files are processed independently by instances that detect them
- Processing throughput scales linearly with the number of instances
- Configurable chunk sizes allow fine-tuning per instance capacity

### Consistency Guarantees

**Idempotent Processing**
- Metadata store prevents re-processing of already-handled files
- Transaction-based operations ensure atomicity
- PostgreSQL ACID compliance provides consistency across instances
- Failed processing attempts can be safely retried

**Instance Failure Recovery**
- If an instance fails during file processing, the metadata store maintains the state
- Other instances continue processing remaining files
- Failed job can be restarted on a different instance without data loss
- Spring Batch's job repository tracks execution history for auditing

### Monitoring Multi-Instance Deployments

**Per-Instance Metrics**
- Each instance exposes `/actuator/metrics` endpoint with instance-specific data
- Spring Boot provides server.port=0 for dynamic port assignment in Kubernetes
- Instance identifiers can be set via `spring.application.instance-id`

**Centralized Observability**
- All instances write events to the same Kafka topic
- Kafka naturally provides ordering guarantees per partition
- Distributed traces correlate logs across instances via event IDs
- PostgreSQL metadata store provides centralized audit trail

### Deployment Scenarios

**Scale-Up Example (1 to 3 instances):**
```bash
# Instance 1
docker run -e spring.profiles.active=local -e spring.application.instance-id=ingestor-1 transaction-file-ingestor

# Instance 2
docker run -e spring.profiles.active=local -e spring.application.instance-id=ingestor-2 transaction-file-ingestor

# Instance 3
docker run -e spring.profiles.active=local -e spring.application.instance-id=ingestor-3 transaction-file-ingestor
```

All three instances:
- Share the same PostgreSQL metadata store
- Share the same Kafka cluster
- Share the same SFTP server connection
- Coordinate file processing through metadata store
- Independently poll for new files

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.8.0 or higher
- Docker & Docker Compose (for local development)
- PostgreSQL 14+ (or use Docker image)
- Apache Kafka with Schema Registry (or use Docker image)

### Quick Start with Docker Compose

1. **Start Infrastructure Services:**
   ```bash
   # Start PostgreSQL
   cd docker/postgres
   docker-compose up -d
   
   # Start SFTP Server
   cd docker/sftp
   docker-compose up -d
   
   # Start Kafka (if using separate compose file)
   cd docker/kafka
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Build the Application:**
   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments="--spring.profiles.active=local"
   ```

4. **Verify Health:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
   ```

### Configuration

The application uses Spring Boot's externalized configuration with profile-specific files:

- `application.yml` - Common configuration
- `application-local.yml` - Local development overrides

## Development

### Building the Project

```bash
# Clean build
mvn clean package

# Build without running tests
mvn clean package -DskipTests

# Build with specific profile
mvn clean package -Dspring.profiles.active=local
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
mvn test

# Run specific test class
mvn test -Dtest=TransactionFileIngestorApplicationTests

# Run with coverage
mvn clean test jacoco:report
```

### Code Generation

The Avro Maven plugin automatically generates Java classes from schema definitions:

```bash
mvn generate-sources
```

Generated classes are placed in:
```
target/generated-sources/avro/com/harpreetsaund/transaction/avro/
```

### Database Migrations

Liquibase migrations are in:
```
src/main/resources/db/changelog/
```

To create a new migration:
1. Add a new changeset in `db.changelog-master.yaml`
2. Run the application (automatic migration on startup)
3. Or manually run: `mvn liquibase:update`

### Code Style

The project uses Eclipse Java formatting standards defined in `eclipse-java-style.xml`. Configure your IDE to use this style guide.
